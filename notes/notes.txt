TODO:

DONE - sigmoid
DONE - cost function
DONE - train
- add constant term on feature vector
- test against scipy logistic regression

notebook:

- dealing with large / small values
- randomly initializing the parameters
- regularized cost
- include the gradient


- download data
- split train / cv / test
- try the algorithm

- overfitting 
- bias vs variance
